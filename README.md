# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python

This is a small Sentiment Analysis project that demonstrates the ability to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral using Python. It uses the TextBlob library, which provides a simple API for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze a given text and determine the sentiment behind it. It leverages TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis, calculating the polarity score and classifying the sentiment as one of three categories:

- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TextBlob library for sentiment analysis
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for additional language processing support
